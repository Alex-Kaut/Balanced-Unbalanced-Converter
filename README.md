# Balanced audio to unbalanced converter
This project was inspired by the "BEHRINGER POWERPLAY P2" we needed a bunch of similar devices, so I started developing a circuit and a board. We needed: devices with balanced input and unbalanced output to headphones with unipolar power +12 or +18 volts

This is converter schematic from Behringer P1 - it is using bipolar power, unnamed capasitors must be 22pF or similar. Diodes play a protective role.
